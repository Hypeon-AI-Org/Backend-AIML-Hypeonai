# Hypeon AI — Backend

The backend handles all data and API operations for Hypeon AI.

### Core Responsibilities

* Collect and process product data from **Amazon** and **Shopify**.
* Collect social discussions and engagement data from **Reddit** and **TikTok**.
* Clean, normalize, and unify all data into a single structure used by the platform.
* Provide internal APIs for:

  * Product insights (ratings, reviews, pricing)
  * Variant analysis (sizes, colors, price changes)
  * Category-level comparisons
  * Social trend insights from Reddit and TikTok discussions
* Manage database updates, caching, and background processing for large datasets.
* Serve data to the web app and AI models through internal endpoints.
* Handle authentication, request validation, and logging for all backend operations.

### In Short

It’s the system that connects raw e-commerce and social data → cleans and organizes it → makes it available to all Hypeon AI features through secure APIs.
